At other times, one scarcely pays a thought to this difficult to grasp concept, and proceeds with one's own decisions. But for Christ, the will of God was His whole life's purpose. Heb 10:7 (also in verse 9): τότε εἶπον· Ἰδοὺ ἥκω, ἐν κεφαλίδι βιβλίου γέγραπται περὶ ἐμοῦ, τοῦ ποιῆσαι, ὁ θεός, τὸ θέλημά σου. Then I said, ‘Behold, I have come to do your will, O God, as it is written of me in the scroll of the book. He also taught his disciples to pray about the will of God. Matt 6:10 ἐλθέτω ἡ βασιλεία σου, γενηθήτω τὸ θέλημά σου, ὡς ἐν οὐρανῷ καὶ ἐπὶ γῆς· Your kingdom come, your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. The word θέλημα (Theleema; Strong's G2307), which means will, decision, or desire, occurs about 63 times in the NT. More particularly, the greek phrases θέλημα θεοῦ / θέλημα τοῦ θεοῦ / θέλημα τοῦ πατρός mean &quot;the will of God/the will of the Father&quot;. Often, a better sense of the verse may be gotten to by translating the word θέλημα as desire instead of will. What the Lord brought about by pursuing the will of God was untold blessings for millions. Heb 10:10 ἐν ᾧ θελήματι ἡγιασμένοι ἐσμὲν διὰ τῆς προσφορᾶς τοῦ σώματος Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ ἐφάπαξ. And by that will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all. How do we figure out what the will of God entails? Romans 12:2 καὶ μὴ συσχηματίζεσθε τῷ αἰῶνι τούτῳ, ἀλλὰ μεταμορφοῦσθε τῇ ἀνακαινώσει τοῦ νοός, εἰς τὸ δοκιμάζειν ὑμᾶς τί τὸ θέλημα τοῦ θεοῦ, τὸ ἀγαθὸν καὶ εὐάρεστον καὶ τέλειον. Do not be conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, that by testing you may discern what is the will of God, what is good and acceptable and perfect. The only way to figure out the will of God is to be transformed in the mind. Our way of thinking must radically change through the application of the Word of God in the testing and challenging situations of life. So, how do we parse what this means for an ordinary believer? So what about us? What exactly does the will of God translate to for an ordinary Christian? To help us understand this, here are a few other instances in the scriptures of this key phrase: 1 Thess 5:18 ἐν παντὶ εὐχαριστεῖτε· τοῦτο γὰρ θέλημα θεοῦ ἐν Χριστῷ Ἰησοῦ εἰς ὑμᾶς. give thanks in all circumstances; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you. Firstly, the giving of thanks, or in a secondary sense, being thankful in all circumstances is the desire of God, and here using the imperative tense εὐχαριστεῖτε Paul commands it. Because this is a command, any hint of ungratefulness is an act of disobedience. Do I crib and complain about the traffic, the state of the world, the corruption in those around me? This verse is a stark reminder to cease and desist such attitudes and words and embrace instead an unquestioning gratefulness. How difficult it is in the natural self to do this! 1 Thess 4:3: τοῦτο γάρ ἐστιν θέλημα τοῦ θεοῦ, ὁ ἁγιασμὸς ὑμῶν, ἀπέχεσθαι ὑμᾶς ἀπὸ τῆς πορνείας, For this is the will of God your sanctification: that you abstain from sexual immorality; Secondly, the sanctification of the children of God, and their abstaining from immoral sexual conduct, is the desire of God. Again, how difficult it is in the natural self to do this, especially when even a look can cause one to transgress this aspect of the will of God. And then, the will of the Father Matt 21:31 τίς ἐκ τῶν δύο ἐποίησεν τὸ θέλημα τοῦ πατρός; λέγουσιν· Ὁ πρῶτος. λέγει αὐτοῖς ὁ Ἰησοῦς· Ἀμὴν λέγω ὑμῖν ὅτι οἱ τελῶναι καὶ αἱ πόρναι προάγουσιν ὑμᾶς εἰς τὴν βασιλείαν τοῦ θεοῦ. Which of the two did the will of his father?” They said, “The first.” Jesus said to them, “Truly, I say to you the tax collectors and the prostitutes go into the kingdom of God before you. Heb 10:36 ὑπομονῆς γὰρ ἔχετε χρείαν ἵνα τὸ θέλημα τοῦ θεοῦ ποιήσαντες κομίσησθε τὴν ἐπαγγελίαν· For you have need of endurance, so that when you have done the will of God you may receive what is promised. It might be assumed that doing the will of God will be a rewarding experience. But nothing could be further from the truth in a fallen world. Like for the Lord, so it is for us; the will of God is not immediately rewarding, but requires patience to see its fruit. The rewards of doing the will of God Mark 3:35 ὃς γὰρ ἂν ποιήσῃ τὸ θέλημα τοῦ θεοῦ, οὗτος ἀδελφός μου καὶ ἀδελφὴ καὶ μήτηρ ἐστίν. For whoever does the will of God, he is my brother and sister and mother.”"},{"title":"Clean Theme Documentation","description":null,"tags":[],"slug":"README","html":"A minimal, clean theme for Marmite static site generator.
